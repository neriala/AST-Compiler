**Project Summary â€“ Compiler Development**  
As part of the "Introduction to Compilation" course, I developed a compiler for an abstract programming language. In this project:

- Designed and implemented a lexical analyzer (Lexer) to identify tokens from the source code.
- Constructed a parser to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and validate the syntax.
- Performed semantic analysis to ensure consistency and enforce language rules.
- Developed an intermediate code generation mechanism and integrated initial optimizations.

This project enhanced my skills in programming language design, complex problem-solving, and efficient algorithm implementation, demonstrating both my technical knowledge and practical expertise in the field.
